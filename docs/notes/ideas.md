## Main Project

!!! abstract
    For the main project, I will be investigating how we can RBIG to examine the spatial-temporal relationships within the data

### Ideas


#### Density Cubes

> The idea is to look at density cubes (spatial-temporal features) and how they aid in extracting information about the ESDC. 

* Information - Highlight Low Probability Events
* Entropy - Compare different spatial-temporal configurations
* Mutual Information - compare the MI content within different spatial-temporal configurations
* Variation of Information - plot on a Taylor Diagram to visual differences

#### Density Cubes + Modeling

> The idea would be to see

#### Density Cubes + Dimension Reduction

> The idea is to see how changing the amount of features changes the amount of H, MI within the

## Applications

---

### Drought Indicators

!!! abstract
    As a potential application, I would like to investigate how we can use Information theory measures to look at drought variable indicators.

---

### Climate Models

!!! abstract
    I will look into how we can compare different climate models. **Part I**: we can look at different measurements and **Part II**: we can look at how the spatial-temporal relationships can affect the comparison metrics.
