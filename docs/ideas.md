# Ideas

---

## Main Project

!!! abstract
    For the main project, I will be investigating how we can RBIG to examine the spatial-temporal relationships within the data


## Applications

---

### Drought Indicators

!!! abstract
    As a potential application, I would like to investigate how we can use Information theory measures to look at drought variable indicators.

---

### Climate Models

!!! abstract
    I will look into how we can compare different climate models. **Part I**: we can look at different measurements and **Part II**: we can look at how the spatial-temporal relationships can affect the comparison metrics.
